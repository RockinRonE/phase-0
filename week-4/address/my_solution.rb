# Format an Address




# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].


# Your Solution Below


def make_address (street, city, state, zip)

	 "You live at " + street + ", in the beautiful city of " + city + ", " + state + ". Your zip is " + zip + "."
end

#For some reason this wouldn't pass rspec with puts before the string. Removing puts allowed it to pass BUT now the #program won't run


#make_address("633 Folsom St.", "San Francisco", "CA", "04107")
