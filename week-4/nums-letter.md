What does puts do?

What is an integer? What is a float?

	An interger is a whole number, i.e. no decimals. A float is a number with a decimal, i.e. not a whole number. 

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

	Math with integers will always return an integer. It ignores the any remander. For example 9/2 will output 4 and no remander. However math with floats will return a more complete answer, such as 4.5 for our division example. 


Hours in a Year:

```ruby

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

	Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are exactly how we humans do math. Division is a bit different. Given and integer, Ruby will return an integer (no decimal). If you want an exact answer, you need to make it a float.

What is the difference between integers and floats?

	An integer is a whole number (no decimal) and a float is a number with a decimal.

What is the difference between integer and float division?

	Answered in first question. 

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

	A string is a line of letters. We use them to create words. Words are then put together to form paragraphs and so on :) 

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

	Local variables are used to store information. Useful, for example, if you had a string or an equation that you wanted to use more than once. It's easier to type the variable name instead of the line or equation in it's entirety 

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

	I thought the Release 5 excercises were good practice. I made mistakes, struggled to overcome them, and ulitmately did!
