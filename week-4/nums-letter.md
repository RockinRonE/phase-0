What is an integer? What is a float?

	An interger is a whole number, i.e. no decimals. A float is a number with a decimal, i.e. not a whole number. 

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

	Math with integers will always return an integer. It ignores the any remander. For example 9/2 will output 4 and no remander. However math with floats will return a more complete answer, such as 4.5 for our division example.
