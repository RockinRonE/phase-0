// There are two different groups of numbers. The first group has a odd amount of numbers in it. The second group has an even amount.

// 1)As the user I am trying create a function that checks for the sum(total) amount in each of the two different group. The sum is the result of adding two or more numbers together.

	//Iterate through the array
		//Add the numbers 



// 2)The first sum we are trying to find is based on an odd amount of individual numbers in the First group. You can find the mean by taking the average of the numbers

	//Iterate through the array
		//Add the numbers 




// 3)The second sum we are trying to find is based on an even amount of individual numbers in the Second group.

	//Iterate through the array
		//Add the numbers 


// 4) As the user I am trying create a second function that will check the for the mean(average) number in each of the two different groups.

	//Iterate through array
		//Add the numbers
		//divide by the array length to find mean




// 5)The first Mean number we are trying to find is based on an odd amount of individual numbers in the First group.

	//Iterate through array
		//Add the numbers
		//divide by the array length to find mean


// 6)The second Mean number we are trying to find is based on an even amount of individual numbers in the Second group.

	//Iterate through array
		//Add the numbers
		//divide by the array length to find mean

// 7)As the user I am trying create a third and final function that will check two different collections for the median number in each one. To find the median you would put the numbers into value order high to low and select the middle number.

	//SORT array in ascending order
		//divide array length by 2
			//IF divisble then return value in middle 
			//ELSE return two middle values added together and then divide by 2


// 8)The first median(middle) number we are trying to find is based on an odd amount of individual numbers in the First group.

	//the pseudocode for 7 takes care of this but here's the breakdown

	//SORT array in ascending order
		//if array has a remainder
			//take the length of array divided by 2 middle number

// 9)The second median(middle)  number we are trying to find is based on an odd amount of individual numbers in the Second group.

	//SORT array in ascending order
		//if array does not have remainder
			//take the two middle numbers, add, and divide by two
