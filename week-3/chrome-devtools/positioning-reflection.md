How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

	The DevTools allows you to modify the CSS for any web page. It's a good way to test out and experiment with CSS before adding it to your file.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

	You can resize by using the width and height properties. 

What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

	Absolute - like the name suggests, it removes the element from the DOM and positions it exactly where you want it

	Fixed - the element stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled. It's positioned, like absolute, using top, right, bottom, and left props.

	Static - default. Not positioned in any special way, just according to the normal flow of the page

	Relative - positioned "relative" to its normal position. Position props adjust it from it's normal position

What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?

	The border is the border of a div. The margin is the space outside of the border and padding refers to the space inside the div. 

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

	As someone with a decent amount of CSS experience, this was one of the more interesting challenges so far. Me and my pair had fun working on it and I was able to guide and teach.
