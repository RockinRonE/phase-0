  <h1>All About Version Control</h1>
  <h2>Version Control and You</h2>
  <h4>Sept., 10th 2015</h4>

  <h3>Why Use Version Control?</h3>
  <ul style="list-style-type:none">
    <li><em>Client:</em> We would like a login form for our customers. Can you do that?</li>

    <li><em>You:</em> Of course! I'll work on that. (<em>Works for hours, updates site</em>).</li>

    <li><em>Client:</em> Nice login, but we actually decided against it. Can you remove it?</li>

    <li><em>You:</em> Oh...sure. (<em>Deletes code </em>)</li>

    <li><em>Client, few days later:</em> Actually we would like it! My boss thought it was great.</li>

    <li><em>You:</em> Argh! I have to code it from scratch again!</li>
  </ul>
      
      <p>In the world of web development this situation can happen. Version control is the best way to protect yourself while allowing you to do so much more. 

      Version control allows you to take your original code, known as a master, and duplicate it as a "branch." A branch is your copy of the code for you to do whatever you'd like to it. Your changes are tracked and you save, or "commit" them. When you're finished you then merge this new code with the master. Why is this beneficial? Say the above situation actually happened. The programmer removes the login but then the client wants it back. All the programmer would have to do is restore the previous version! </p>

      <h4>Additional Benefits</h4>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Collaboration</li>
        <p>Version control allows every team member to have their own copy of the master code to make changes to. The updated code then can be compared to the original and if everyone approves, be merged into the master copy. This is a great way for a team to work on multiple facets of a project simultaneously. One of the most popular services is GitHub, which I'll discuss below.  </p>

        <li>What's Going On?</li>
        <p>Version control keeps track of changes that are made so you will always know exactly what changed, who did it, and when. This is useful in case a bug was introduced into the code unnoticed. It can be tracked</p> 

        <li>Backup</li>
        <p>Since your teammates all have a copy of the master code, version control becomes a way of backing up the code.</p>
      </ol>
    
    <h3>GitHub</h3>
      <p>
        GitHub uses the version control system Git to keep track of changes on its site, hence the name GitHub. GitHub is a remote repository in which you can store your code. This is great for teams because each person can download a copy of the master code on GitHub to their own computer. That person then can branch off of it, makes changes, and then send it back to GitHub for their peers to review. This is known as a "pull request." A pull request gives you the opportunity to review the changes made by your teammate and read their reasoning behind it. If it looks good you can then accept the changes and merge them into the master code.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

	I think section and aside tags will be used most often. Nav, main,  header, and footer are more one-time use tags. 

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

	The order is according to the DOM, starting at the HTML tag. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

	I already had packages with shortcuts and snippets already installed for Sublime.
