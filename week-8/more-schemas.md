One-to-one Relationship

I see this as a one-to-one because a Person can only have one cust_num and a cust_num can only belong to one person.

Many to Many

REFLECTION:

What is a one-to-one database?

	It's when a value can only be associated with another value and vice versa. Like how we only have one social security number and it's never shared amongst people. 

When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

	I would think when two values are exclusively dependent on each other. Unique values, etc.
	
What is a many-to-many database?

	It's when you need multiple instances on both sides of the relationships. 

When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

	I would think when you have two tables that have related data and need a join table.

What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?

	One-to-one is still a bit fuzzy but I think I get the rest. More work within table logic will most likely solify my understanding.
