Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

	To create a repository, start at your GitHub account homepage. Click the + sign at the upper right hand corner of the screen and select "New Repository." Give it a name and click the "Create Repository" button. To clone the repository you'll need to copy the HTTPS clone URL. Navigate to where you want your repository on your computer using the terminal. Type in git clone copied_URL and you're good! 

Describe what open source means.

	Open source is when your code is freely available to the public

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

	On one hand it is cool that there are projects and what not that are freely shared for people to build on. On the other hand I can completely understand why a private business would not share their code. 

Assess the importance of using licenses.

	Licensing ensures that software will be used and distributed in accordance to the author(s). 


What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

	I struggled with how exactly Git/GitHub worked in terms of git add and then git commit. I watched the videos a few times over, but this resource really helped me get the bigger picture ALONG with DBC content:
