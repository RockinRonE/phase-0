#1.1 Think About Time

I already have a working time management system that involves writing down what I want to accomplish over the week and breaking it down into achievable parts each day. I currently use the pomodoro technique and eliminate all distractions during a pomodoro. I‘ve done freelance work as a side hustle for over a year and now full time. In order to actually do client work, improve my skills, and have a happy life with crunched time, I’ve become disciplined with my time.

 

A cool productivity idea I did learn about was Tiny Habits! Great video. I immediately put it to use by saying, “After a pomodoro, I will do one set of my workout.” I also plan on doing this to keep myself from drinking too much at social events. Not that I’m obviously drunk or anything, I just don’t like that “off” feeling the next day. And I don’t want to be down a day while doing DBC with so much learning and money on the line! So another tiny habit will be, “After I have a drink, I will have a glass of water.”

 

Speaking of the pomodoro technique, this is a type of “time boxing.” I intend to use it to prevent myself from getting burnt out and to keep my mind fresh. It also allows me to see how much I can accomplish within a pomodoro. This will help me gauge how long it will take to complete an assignment. Soon I’ll be able to say that a “short” assignment is 1 pomodoro, which for me is 30 minutes.

 

My overall plan is to look over what’s required and the bonus material and divide it by 7. For example, I counted 20 assignments and divide that by 7, I need to complete at least 3 per day. Until I get a better sense what short, medium, medium-long, and long is, this is what I’m shooting for. Then I’ll use the pomodoro technique to tackle these assignments.


#1.2 The Command Line

A shell is a user interface, either the command line or a graphic user interface, to access a computer’s operations. Bash is a type of command line shell used to interact with the computer with it’s own set of commands like “mkdir.”

 

The most challenging part for me was realizing that I didn’t completely understand the previous lessons as I thought. After a few lessons I had to go back and redo the previous lessons to solidify my understanding. I was able to use all of the commands.

 

I think the most important commands are the ones listed until finding help using apropos. That and hostname. The ones before apropos create and manipulate directories and files, which I’d imagine we’ll need to do often.

 

pwd - print working directory  

ls - list contents in the current directory  

mv - creates a copy of the file with a new name..kinda moves it? I found this to have an odd name  

cd - change directory  

../ - goes down a directory when used with cd  

touch - creates a basic file  

mkdir - makes a directory  

less - way to read a txt file. Prints it in separate window  

rmdir - removes a directory  

rm - removes a file  

help - when used with a command, such as “help cd”, it will tell you how that command works and how to use it  




#1.4 Forking and Cloning

 To create a new repo, click on the + at the upper right hand corner of your GitHub account page and select “New Repository.” You now have a new repo.

 

To fork a repo of your choice, go to that repo and click the “fork” button and select yourself when prompted with a pop up. You now have a fork of that repo. Forking a repository is an easy way to copy repository of interest so you can experiment without affecting the original project.

 

To clone a repo you need to copy the HTTPS  clone URL. In CLI, navigate to where you want to put the clone. Then use “git clone [URL]” where the URL is the clone URL you copied.

 

I didn’t have any real struggles since I knew how to use git from previous experience. The only thing I didn’t realize I had to do is clone my phase-0 repository at first.
