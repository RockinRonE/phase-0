What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

	My site's primary goal is to service as a way for people and potential clients to find me and my work and provide a way to contact me. The content will be links and images of my work as well as my blog. 

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

	I think my audience would like to see what my past and current work is and hopefully my blog :) I will be sure to keep this as the focus of my site, i.e. no clutter. 

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

	I think the primary action would be to get to know me a little more. I would like it if they found my blog interesting or were impressed by my work. I'd definitely keep a contact me button on the side of each page. 

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

	Design and UX go hand in hand. The design of a site effects a user's experience. Conducting tests to see how different designs affect UX is what the UX field is all about. 

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

	UX is all about how a person feels when interacting with a site, app, software, etc. It's valuable because we make products for users and you want them to have an easy and enjoyable time with your product. The more so the more money or value you'll get out of it. 

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

	None. I have prior experience.
