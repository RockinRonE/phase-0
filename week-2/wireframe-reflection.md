What is a wireframe?

	It's a mockup of how you want your site to look and feel.

What are the benefits of wireframing?

	It helps conceptualize the site. For example it can help in determining how a user will interact with a site. It also allows a designer to plan the layout with distractions from color, etc. Like the foundation of a building. 

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

	Not really. I've never experienced a big benefit to wireframing. I usually sketch it out on a piece of paper, iterate, and start working on it. 

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

	Stuck with my first idea. 

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

	One thing I did get out of this exercise was that it helped me to focus on who my end user would be. I would like that to be prospective clients and employers, so it helped me to empathize. 

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

	Overall it was fine. Google Draw made it easy and free of hassle to create the wireframes (instead of signing up to a temp free account with some service).
